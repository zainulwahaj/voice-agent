echo "VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here" > .env
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start MCP Server
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd google-calendar-mcp
npm run dev:http
```

You should see:
```
üöÄ MCP Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
```bash
# Back in voice-agent-app directory
npm run test-setup
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ MCP Server is running
‚úÖ Found 10 tools
‚úÖ Calendar data accessible
```

### Step 4: Start Voice Agent
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/index-new.html**

### Step 6: Initialize & Use

1. **Click "Initialize Agent"**
   - Wait for: "Connected with 10 calendar tools" ‚úÖ

2. **Click "Start Conversation"**
   - Grant microphone permission
   - Wait for: "Microphone active - speak to me!" ‚úÖ

3. **Start Talking**
   - "What's on my calendar today?"
   - "Do I have any meetings tomorrow?"
   - "Create a meeting at 2 PM tomorrow"
   - "When am I free on Friday?"

## Expected Behavior

### Initialization (5-10 seconds)
```
üì° Fetching MCP tools...
‚úÖ Fetched 10 tools from MCP server
üöÄ Initializing voice agent...
üîå Connected to OpenAI Realtime API
‚úÖ Session created
‚úÖ Voice agent initialized with 10 tools
```

### Starting Conversation (2-3 seconds)
```
üé§ Starting conversation...
üé§ Microphone capture started
```

### Voice Interaction
1. **You speak:** "What's on my calendar?"
2. **Console:** `üé§ User started speaking`
3. **Console:** `üé§ User stopped speaking`
4. **Console:** `üìù User said: "What's on my calendar?"`
5. **Console:** `üîß Function call complete: list-events`
6. **Console:** `‚úÖ MCP tool result: {...}`
7. **Console:** `üí¨ Assistant said: "You have 3 events..."`
8. **Console:** `üîä Audio response complete`
9. **You hear:** üîä Assistant's voice response

## Troubleshooting

### "MCP Server not accessible"
```bash
cd google-calendar-mcp
npm run dev:http
```
Make sure you see: `üöÄ MCP Server running on http://localhost:3000`

### "WebSocket connection failed"
- Check `.env` file has correct `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Verify API key has Realtime API access
- Check console for error details

### "Microphone not working"
- Click the lock icon in browser address bar
- Allow microphone access
- Refresh the page and try again

### "No transcription events"
- Check browser console for audio errors
- Verify microphone is working (test in other apps)
- Try using HTTPS instead of HTTP

## Quick Test Commands

### Test MCP Connection Only
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/mcp/tools
```
Should return JSON with 10 tools.

### Test Calendar Access
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp/call-tool \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "list-events",
      "arguments": {"calendarId": "primary", "maxResults": 5}
    }
  }'
```
Should return calendar events.

### Test OpenAI API Key
```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```
Should return list of models (including gpt-4o-realtime-preview).
